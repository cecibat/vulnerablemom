							<p>Since I have memory I have always pictured myself as a mother. I have always known I wanted to be a mom, and in 2023 both my husband and I felt it was finally the right time: we were ready to be parents.</p>
							<p>The pregnancy was not the smoothest as I had a million of little problems, and the delivery was also not as I expected: at 38+2 I was told my baby was in distress and suffering. I was induced, and the after 12 hours my little one was on my chest.</p>
							<p>My motherhood journey starts then: February 2024. The first two days were intense because of tiredness, painful breastfeeding and taking care of a tiny human. On the third day, the baby blues hit me and my feeling of "I want to be a mom" turned into "I am not capable of being a mother. I want my life back. Why did we do this?".</p>
							<p>That was the start of a long journey. I was diagnosed with major post-partum depression 3 weeks after I gave birth - and I struggled with it for over 6.5 months. I started getting better when my daily schedule started to be more predictable.</p>
